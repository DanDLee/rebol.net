===Style===
&lt;TABLE CELLPADDING=10 CELLSPACING=10&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=50% VALIGN=TOP&gt;
'''Face/style''' is the name of the style, not the style object. It's implemented this way mainly for debugging reasons: if you print the face, you don't have to see the entire style specification, which can be fairly long.
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD VALIGN=TOP&gt;
For example, a button object would have:

  style: 'button

The map between style names and their definitions is stored in the main module object for the GUI system. New styles can be added to this map as needed.
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
