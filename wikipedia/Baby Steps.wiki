'''This is an important note to all alpha testers:'''

Test R3 one step at a time. Start with:

   &gt;&gt; 1 + 2
   == 3

Then try:

   &gt;&gt; a: 1
   &gt;&gt; a + 2
   == 3

Ever see the movie, ''What about Bob?''. Well: '''Baby steps.''' That's the mindset.

That's what you need to do. Don't do more.

Don't &lt;tt&gt;do&lt;/tt&gt; your largest script. '''''We guarantee it won't work.'''''

Don't try obscure complex functions. They won't work! Guaranteed.

Take things just one small little step at a time. Find all those little bugs first. We'll get those little ones fixed, then move to the next baby step.
