Internal dialects such as DRAW, EFFECT, TEXT (richtext), and SECURE use a new mixed-code method where the dialect itself is defined in Rebol, but the dialect evaluation is implemented in C code.

Many of the dialects used in Rebol are keyword-based command languages. These dialects are not defined by sophisticated grammars, but rather by simple command sequences followed by a number of optional arguments. They are not intended to be anything more than that.

In prior versions of Rebol, internal dialects such as DRAW, EFFECT, and others were implemented entirely in C code within the Rebol interpreter. Hence, it was not possible to change the dialect without having access to the C source code.

However, in 3.0, it is easier to define and refine these kinds of dialects using Rebol itself.

'''For this purpose a new function is available: [[Delect]]'''

DELECT converts a keyword command dialect with optional arguments (like View layout) into separate command blocks with fixed argument lists, the missing optional arguments being replaced with NONE values.

A few of the special dialects used by Rebol are defined in the system/dialects object. (But, not all dialects are defined in this way.)
