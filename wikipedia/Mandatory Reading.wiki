{{Cookbook|title=Mandatory Reading|author=Henrik Mikael Kristensen|level=1|category=RT Developer}}

If you are a Rebol Technologies employee or a developer closely attached to Rebol Technologies and therefore R3 alpha development, here are some documents residing in DocBase, that we consider mandatory reading. If you read these documents, we hope you will be able to use our basic tools for Rebol development.

* [http://www.rebol.com/r3/devbase/index.html DevBase] - The source management tool that we use internally to keep track of your uploaded changes to various Rebol sources, such as R3, Devbase itself, small tools, etc.
* [[Release Process]] - A cookbook recipe on how the release process for Rebol 3 works.

If you are going to be involved in DocBase writing, these make for a good read:

* [[About Cookbooks]] -  The principle behind cookbooks and how to add new cookbooks and recipes.
