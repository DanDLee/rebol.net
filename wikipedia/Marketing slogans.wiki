Rebol is a fusion and "sweet spot" sought by a careful blend of features tuned for over a decade, so it is hard to capture that in a single sentence (or several).  Yet choosing these carefully and using them purposefully is good because it helps people quickly understand what tasks the language shines at.  It also gives quotable guidance when helping give feedback to new users who might not have grasped the "Zen".

= Marketing Slogans =

In this context, a marketing slogan is a higher-level capture of the philosophy.  It's something you're unlikely to invoke in dialogue when giving feedback on someone's code.  It's better to have only a few of these.

== From The Past ==

=== REBOL rebels against software complexity ===

* very solid and rings true with what Rebol is
* is punchier as this simple statement rather than phrasing "Rebelling against large, expensive, complex software"

=== Do it in 1MB, not 200MB. ===

* true that small size correlates with good factoring, but perhaps saved for the right time (the download page?)
* at some level, focusing on the size of the interpreter+libraries isn't all that relevant outside of embedded or multiprocessing server markets, though in-memory size matters more
* management of complexity at source level is more important than the size of the object file (e.g. turning on compiler optimizations [http://www.rebol.net/r3blogs/0297.html makes the executable bigger]...should they be off?)

=== Building the future ===

* Current R3 blog tagline
* Does not seem to carry much information

=== Smarter, Smaller, Better ===

* was originally used with Web 3.0 Starts Here Slogan, but could as well be used separately
* it feels like giving a world a clear and short message of what REBOL is

=== Make IT Simple ===

* Not all software developers label themselves to be "IT people" (e.g. [http://ask.slashdot.org/story/09/11/28/2353241/Do-You-Hate-Being-Called-an-IT-Guy this article])
* Made Rebol sound like it might be a sysadmin tool or some kind of virtual web host control panel

=== Web 3.0 Starts Here ===

* people who would rally and use term "Web 3.0" would never agree Rebol is suited to be called this
* people who understand what this is supposed to mean likely wouldn't use the term "Web 3.0"

=== Vive la REBOLution ===

* a little too goofy to use without a smiley after it :)

=== Relative Expression Based Object Language ===

* a solid meaning behind word "Rebol"
* unclear if presenting this to users early on causes more confusion than good
* naming with acronyms and all caps not currently in vogue

=== The lightweight platform for Internet applications ===

* "lightweight" has some positive and negative connotations
* today's expectations of claiming "platform" for "Internet applications" is beyond just language scope (Rails, Django, Pylons, WebObjects)
* better to sharpen focus on "*Internet Included"? ''(e.g. how many other languages can effectively #include libraries via http address)''

== Brainstorm New Marketing Slogans ==

=== Rebol is the rebellion against software complexity ===

* Same sentiment as before but scans better than ''REBOL rebels against...''
* ''"It's not just '''a''' rebellion, it's '''the''' rebellion"''

=== Version 3: It's Rebol. Rebooted. ===

* suggests a massive change instead of just a continuation of Rebol 2 with Unicode
* much of this massive change would be about perspective, not just technology
* clear communication of an open source story and community contract
* a lot of these things are in the works but just not visible yet

=== The next generation of the old school ===

* reword of ‘We are of the old school but of the next generation.’ [http://www.rebol.com/cgi-bin/blog.r?view=0374#comments proposed as motto here]
* true that it's tough to grasp Rebol unless you've clocked some time in software

= Mottos =

Mottos are something you can have an unlimited number of, if they ring true and are useful. There's a 20 line summary called [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ The Zen of Python], which says things like: "Explicit is better than implicit.", "Readability counts.", "Flat is better than nested."

So what is [[The Zen of Rebol]]?  How many premises from other languages can be said to apply equally well to Rebol, if not better?  Which are contentious with the Rebol worldview?  And which are completely new?  Each motto should be backed up by some code samples instead of just being abstract.  If someone asks what a motto means, just link to that page.

== From The Past ==

=== There Are No Keywords ===

* Has this "sold" people and do they like hearing it?
* Might be better to stress layering and levels of mutability/immutability, like, say, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic Nomic]?
* ''you can build your own variant of the language'' may sound better than something that sounds like ''we didn't build a language, so you'll have to''

== Brainstorm New Mottos ==

There's room for dry mottos, as well as colorful ones that call up associations and metaphors (which would lend some more unique personality and perhaps some memorable fun/humor.)

=== Turtles all the way down ===

* Well known concept from a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down funny story]
* Emphasizes code as data and the structural coherence in Rebol
* Catchy and quotable, might get people to think about how to use source reflection

=== Inspired by theory, driven by practice ===

* Lifted this from a note in the [http://www.rebol.net/wiki/Parse_Project#Theory_of_PARSE parse project wiki]
* Useful for pointing out any time someone complains that Rebol deviated from theory
** Should be supplemented with the practical use cases

=== Some assembly required ===

* Could be extended to ''Batteries included, but some assembly required''
* Emphasizes need for an efficiency-oriented mindset, both when programming and understanding design tradeoffs
* If this is going to be cited often, cases must be found which resonate with target markets
