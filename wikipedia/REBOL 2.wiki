==What is REBOL==

REBOL is a data exchange language and a programming language, but if you are here you probably already know this.<BR>
It is an interpreted language in which the interpreter loads your program (henceforth called a script) in memory and executes it.<BR><BR>
Some points about REBOL:<BR>

REBOL 2 was released in 1999.<BR>
*REBOL scripts are short and expressive. In a single line you can write an entire program.
*The language can be extended with "dialects" that enable the programmer to add new WORDS for specific domains.
*It is multi-platform. The same script can run on many OS's with no changes.
*It includes a GUI system for light or heavy applications.
*It is FAST. With a single loop you can search for an entry in a million of records in less than a second.

REBOL has been created by one of the gurus of the computing world - [[User:Carl|'''Carl Sassenrath''']].<BR><BR>

==Why REBOL==

'''Why use REBOL?'''

* Tired of installs that consume gigabytes and take hours to configure? REBOL setup is very fast: download the interpreter, run it and the REBOL environment is ready.
* Create applications in less time with its highly expressive yet concise syntax. Download and process an entire web page in one line of code.
* Connect to the X Internet.

==REBOL 2 or REBOL 3?==

REBOL 3 is currently under [[R3_Releases|development]]. The concepts are essentially those of REBOL 2, but it has been extended in many ways.

For any production work, you should use REBOL 2 as it is a complete and quite stable. The adventurous might want to experiment with REBOL 3 in its present state, with the expectation that there will be bugs and undocumented areas to deal with.

Once comfortable with REBOL 2, the changes in REBOL 3 should present no difficulty, and by that time REBOL 3 should be ready for you with a more stable base.
