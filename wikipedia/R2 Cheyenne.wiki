'''The Cheyenne Web Server from SoftInnov'''

Cheyenne is a full-featured, high-performance, Apache-class web server built entirely in REBOL. It is fast, powerful, and amazingly small.

"Cheyenne is built on top of our UniServe async network framework, so it inherits the gains of asynchronous I/O and mono-process lightweight design," states Nenad Rakocevic (DocKimbel), the architect of Cheyenne.

The Cheyenne web server supports HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 protocols, persistent connections (Keep-Alive), advanced browser cache management, virtual hosts, Apache-like modular architecture, smart configuration file with expandable and dedicated dialect, and best of all, direct REBOL CGI support with persistent processes (optimal performance).

Cheyenne also supports a range of built-in modules, such as aliases and redirection, server-side includes, background process user and group rights, REBOL server pages, CGI, chunk-encoding, byte-ranges requests, URL transformations (including direct REBOL function mapping), SSL, and an advanced remote management tool.
