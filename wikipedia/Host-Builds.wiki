'''For temporary plans and notes related to the R3 host kit.'''

See the [http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/concepts/host-kit.html R3 Host Kit Manual] for information about using the host kit to build your own executable.

==Objective==

Release the Rebol 3.0 Host Kit (host environment, including source code, include files, and core library).

===Release Stages===

#[x] Core - Win32 host to initial developers (Dec-2)
#[x] Core - Posix hosts (Linux: Dec-12, OSX: ?, Others)
#[ ] View - experimental releases (draw, richtext, effects)
#[ ] View - final form, with updates to VID for any changes
#[ ] View - ports to Linux, OS X, etc. (from developers)
#[ ] Full release of '''Rebol 3.0 Host Kit'''

===Development Plan===

First stage:

*[x] Reconfigure for Core target (non-View, same as current posix builds)
*[x] Build initial test host and lib
*[x] Debug host and lib
*[x] Review and update all host related include files
*[x] Merge host include files with lib includes (to stay sync'd, if possible)
*[x] Update makefiles (script built)
*[x] Scan host sources for marker tags and review them
*[x] Rename lib function name prefixes? (do not use Rebol_)
*[x] Update host source headers

Second stage:

*[x] Modify build scripts for Posix and makefiles
*[x] Add .so support for Core lib
*[ ] Research the .so equivalent method on OS X

Future:

*Write and post OSLA (two kinds)
*Setup RebDev (R3 Chat) source archive area
*Modify build scripts for dual targets (core and view)
*Move Delect interfaces to Command! based interfaces
*Build view target
*Add more documentation, as needed
