'''Face/gob''' holds the graphical object that implements face rendering. It is normally a DRAW type of GOB, but for text that requires no background or borders, it is optimized to be a TEXT GOB (richtext).

The face/gob/data field contains a reference back to the face object itself. This allows the display and event sub-systems to process gobs efficiently, but allow access back to the face fields when necessary.
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD VALIGN=TOP&gt;
Some faces will use a face/gob/pane to holds sub-gobs to implement various parts of their display. For example, a scroll bar contains several such sub-gobs for its various components.

It should be noted that the gob/offset and gob/size fields are only approximations of the actual graphic image area. This is due to the anti-aliased graphics engine which requires that the gob be large enough to include pixels that are part of the anti-aliased edges of the face.(This is why the facet/size and facet/area-size have slightly different
values.)
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
