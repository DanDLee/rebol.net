===Faced===

'''Style/faced''' is a prototype object that defines the fields that will be part of the face/facets object. These are the facets that are unique to every face instance.

This object is used to tell the system which variables are local to the face and can be modified, versus those that are part of the style and should remain static.

Note that if a style/faced field is also included in style/facets, the facets value will be copied when the face is made.
