R3 provides two methods for implementing dialects. These two methods have different goals.

# [[Internal dialects]] where the dialect implementaiton is done on the C level
# Normal REBOL based dialects using PARSE and REBOL code for implementation

==Why two different approaches?==
Carl, mentioned the origin for the two different concepts:

# PARSE provides a full range of dialects.
# Most dialects don't require that much power.
# Dialects like DRAW, EFFECT, REBCODE are small subsets
# A faster technique (than parse) can be used for such dialects. 
# That technique was used for DRAW, etc. (native evaluated)
# I decided might as well allow it to be REBOL level too.

DELECT is also performing JIB (Just in time binding).
