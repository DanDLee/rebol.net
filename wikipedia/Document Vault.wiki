In an effort to make the wiki a coherent document, some pages were canobilized to a high degree.  No conclusions should be drawn regarding a contribution that finds its way to the Vault.  Often, the issues described here have been duplicated in other works.  Whats placed in the vault and what is not is often determined by the order of the issues reviewed.
