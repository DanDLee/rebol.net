==Startup File Paths==

System/options fields:

'''boot''' - the location of the exe file, and also where boot looks for rebol.r and user.r files.

'''home''' - the current directory to run from. This depends on how R3 was started. (See note below.)

'''script''' - the script file to evaluate on startup. (See note below.)

'''path''' - the directory of the script file. (should it be deleted?)

Note: When you drag and drop a file onto the R3 icon in win32, the home directory is set to the user's &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; folder. That's not very useful, so R3 changes the home to be that of the script's directory.

The function that implements this boot logic is found in system/intrinsic/begin. Send suggested improvements to Carl.
