The Rebol 3 graphics system has been redesigned in a major way to provide greater performance while at the same time requiring substantially fewer resources (memory and CPU time).

==Requirements==

===Overall Requirements===

*Lightweight - very lean, but powerful new design
*High-speed - for multimedia and video games
*Easy - to learn, debug, understand, and improve

===Functional Requirements===
*Windows - opening and controlling windows on the native OS
*Compositing - layering large numbers of graphical objects with transparency (alpha channel)
*Draw - supporting a wide range of SVG-style drawing functions
*Effects - providing raster operations like earlier versions
*Text - adding better rich-text and font support
*Events - optimized GUI event handling

===Special Requirements===

*Emulate faces - ability to support FACE object for compatibility (mezzanine)
*Virtual windows - rendering graphics into an image
*Timing - event timestamps, animation sync, timers
*Mouse shape - ability to change mouse shape as needed
*Hover focus - focusing events to the context related to the mouse location
*Embedability - allowing the window system to run within other applications
*Embedded operations - such as running video in a window
*OpenGL - ability to easily support OpenGL operations later

==Graphical Objects: GOBs==

The new system is based on a new graphical object structure called a [[GOB]].

GOBs are implemented as a native Rebol datatype, but with highly optimized internal structure to minimize memory requirements. With the new design, it should be possible to create graphical displays and interfaces that contain thousands of objects, but with much less impact on memory than in prior versions.
