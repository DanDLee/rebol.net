Here are the steps to obtain the current GUI source code:

#Run R3
#Type: chat
#Login (if you need to)

Now type this at the chat console:

&lt;pre&gt;
   &gt;&gt; 2586
   R3/GUI/Source:
   ...
   &gt;&gt; get *

   &gt;&gt; 2656
   R3/GUI/Source/styles-proto
   ...
   &gt;&gt; get *
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, open the source dir:

   &gt;&gt; od

Run R3 with gui-test.r to test that the GUI loads properly. A verification window should open with text and a couple buttons.

To build the GUI as a single package file, run gui-build.r and it will output a file: gui.r that you can use.
