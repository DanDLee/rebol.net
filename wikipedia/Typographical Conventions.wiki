==Suggested conventions for documenting REBOL==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Category !!Style !!How to do it in WikiText
|-
| emphasized text || ''emphasized text'' || &lt;nowiki&gt; ''emphasized text''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (double apostrophe)
|-
| REBOL words || '''''bold-and-italic''''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'''''bold-and-italic'''''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (quintuple apostrophe)
|-
| values of REBOL variables|| '''bold''' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'''bold'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (triple apostrophe)
|-
| embedded REBOL expression || &lt;tt&gt;typewriter text&lt;/tt&gt; || &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;typewriter text&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;
|}

Note: REBOL variables are REBOL words that are bound to a context, unbound words don't have values.

Use:
#'''do''' to represent the value of the '''''do''''' variable - in a fresh console this is a native that does not have a serialized form
#'''none''' to represent the value of the '''''none''''' variable - in a fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as &lt;tt&gt;#[none]&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;#[none!]&lt;/tt&gt;
#'''true''' to represent the value of the '''''true''''' variable - in a fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as &lt;tt&gt;#[true]&lt;/tt&gt;
#'''unset!''' to represent the value of the '''''unset!''''' variable - in a fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as &lt;tt&gt;#[datatype! unset!]&lt;/tt&gt;
#'''unset''' to represent the value of the '''''unset''''' variable - in a fresh console this is a native that does not have a serialized form
, etc.

The above rules mean, that the &lt;tt&gt;#[unset!]&lt;/tt&gt; value should be represented using neither of '''''unset''''' (the word), '''unset''' (the native), '''''unset!''''' (the word), '''unset!''' (the datatype).
