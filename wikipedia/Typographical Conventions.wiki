==Suggested conventions for documenting REBOL==

{| class="wikitable"
!Category !!Style !!How to do it in WikiText
|-
| emphasized text || ''emphasized text'' || <nowiki> ''emphasized text''</nowiki> (double apostrophe)
|-
| REBOL words || '''''bold-and-italic''''' || <nowiki>'''''bold-and-italic'''''</nowiki> (quintuple apostrophe)
|-
| values of REBOL variables|| '''bold''' || <nowiki>'''bold'''</nowiki> (triple apostrophe)
|-
| embedded REBOL expression || <tt>typewriter text</tt> || &lt;tt&gt;typewriter text&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

Note: REBOL variables are REBOL words that are bound to a context, unbound words don't have values.

Use:
#'''do''' to represent the value of the '''''do''''' variable - in a fresh console this is a native that does not have a serialized form
#'''none''' to represent the value of the '''''none''''' variable - in a fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as <tt>#[none]</tt> or <tt>#[none!]</tt>
#'''true''' to represent the value of the '''''true''''' variable - in a fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as <tt>#[true]</tt>
#'''unset!''' to represent the value of the '''''unset!''''' variable - in a fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as <tt>#[datatype! unset!]</tt>
#'''unset''' to represent the value of the '''''unset''''' variable - in a fresh console this is a native that does not have a serialized form
, etc.

The above rules mean, that the <tt>#[unset!]</tt> value should be represented using neither of '''''unset''''' (the word), '''unset''' (the native), '''''unset!''''' (the word), '''unset!''' (the datatype).
