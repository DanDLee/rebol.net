Micro-VID is a very simple dialect that can be used to create windows without having to fiddle with GOBs directly.

It looks like VID although it's much simpler and uses the new fast dialect method. Current available dialect words and styles are: ''return, at, size, button, h1, h2, text, image, slider''. Text styles can take a string of text or a block of rich text dialect. A second block (or the first block if you use a string for the text) can be used for the action. Sizes currently need to be specified manually. (''return'' does not do much either.)

Note that Micro-VID is here just for testing. Do not take it too seriously. But I'm sure you'll find it useful.
