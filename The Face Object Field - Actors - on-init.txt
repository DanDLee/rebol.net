*on-init* is invoked after
*link:The Face Object Field - Actors - on-resize[on-resize]*, first on
regular faces and then on trigger faces. At this state the face is
completely ready for use, and you can for example reset it to a default
value with the
*link:The Face Object Field - Actors - on-reset[on-reset]* actor.
