This describes the requestor mechanism in the link:R3_GUI[R3 GUI].


Basics
~~~~~~

Requestors are small popup windows used to inform the user or request
specific types of information. They are allowed to be modal (wait for
user response) or non-modal.


Typical Requestors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REBOL GUI supplies the most commonly used requestors, so you don't
need to provide them in your own applications. Examples are:

* *alerts* - urgent messages to user
* *dialogs* - informative messages
* *questions* - prompting user for decision
* *string* - asking for string input (general)
* *user-pass* - username and password
* *color* - select a color
* *time* - pick a time
* *calendar* - pick a date
* *file* - open or save a file
* *directory* - indicate a directory

Others are also possible, and of course you can create your own custom
requestors.


General Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General characteristics of requstors are:

* *popup* - opens small window to get user's attention
* *modal* - locks out events for other windows (optional)
* *on-top* - stays on top of other windows
* *no caption* - no title bar or close box
* *centered* - over screen or app window
* *auto-close* - response can close the popup


Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~

There are two general types of requestors: modal and non-modal.

Modal requestors will open a window and will block events that are sent
to all windows except the one that has been opened. For example, if you
need to ask the user to "Please confirm deletion?" a modal requestor
will wait until the user responds, and no other windows can be used.
Modal requestors are also convenient to use because their results are
returned from the function.

A non-modal requestor will open a window but will not block events to
other windows. The requestor will return immediately, and you must check
later (or use a callback function) to determine the result of the
request. They are useful in cases where you want the user to make some
choices, but those choices are not critical to the application. Color
selection is a typical example.


Modal
^^^^^

Here is the general mechanism of a modal requestor. This sequence is for
a simple yes-no dialog question.

1.  REQUEST function called
2.  REQUEST builds panel then calls VIEW
3.  VIEW opens a popup window to show the panel
4.  VIEW calls WAIT to process GUI events
5.  VIEW suspends at the WAIT
6.  Various GUI events get processed (via event port)
7.  User clicks on YES or NO button
8.  Popup stores result in its window face
9.  Popup face reactor (CLOSE) calls UNVIEW
10. UNVIEW closes the popup window
11. UNVIEW tells WAIT to awake
12. WAIT returns, code resumes in VIEW (called earlier)
13. VIEW returns window (GOB, face)
14. REQUEST function gets result from window and returns it (face/state)


Non-Modal
