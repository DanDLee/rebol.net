Actors
^^^^^^

The *actors* field of the compound object of a face is a map of the
functions that define the behavior of the face. Whenever an event or
other action occurs, these are the functions that handle it. (In some
GUI systems, these are called _interactors_.)

If a style object is derived from a parent style, the parent actors are
inherited from the parent object. But the derived actors are not bound
to the parent. This allows the functions of the actor to be more
efficiently reused in all instances of the face. Within an actor, a
reference to a facet is made via special access functions.

*Typical actors are:* <TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=50% VALIGN=TOP>

* *link:The Face Object Field - Actors - on-make[on-make]* - when face
is first created to initialize special values

values are set
* *link:The Face Object Field - Actors - on-clear[on-clear]* - when the
state values are cleared
* *link:The Face Object Field - Actors - on-key[on-key]* - when key has
been pressed (for our focus)

* *link:The Face Object Field - Actors - on-attach[on-attach]* - when a

</TD></TR></TABLE> There is no need to define actors that are not
needed. New actors can be created as required.

Actor functions are called using the DO-STYLE function. For example:

` do-style face 'on-click true`

The action is ignored if the face has no on-click actor.
