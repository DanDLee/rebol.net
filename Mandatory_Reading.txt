If you are a REBOL Technologies employee or a developer closely attached
to REBOL Technologies and therefore R3 alpha development, here are some
documents residing in DocBase, that we consider mandatory reading. If
you read these documents, we hope you will be able to use our basic
tools for REBOL development.

* http://www.rebol.com/r3/devbase/index.html[DevBase] - The source
management tool that we use internally to keep track of your uploaded
changes to various REBOL sources, such as R3, Devbase itself, small
tools, etc.
* link:Release_Process[Release Process] - A cookbook recipe on how the
release process for REBOL 3 works.

If you are going to be involved in DocBase writing, these make for a
good read:

* link:About_Cookbooks[About Cookbooks] - The principle behind cookbooks
and how to add new cookbooks and recipes.
