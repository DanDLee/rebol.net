Main Note
~~~~~~~~~

The GUI works. The primary design achieves most of my goals, although it
still has some rough edges.

*Keep in mind you are using an _alpha_* -- which means it will have some
problems and will even crash at times. Some of these problems we know
about, others we don't.

Also, if you are using variations of the GUI done by anyone but me,
_they are experimental prototypes_' and may have other problems. They
may also contain concepts that may or may not be in the final design,
since they still have to pass the Carl filter.

So, my advice in general is, *not to worry*. We will fix everything. We
are committed to this being a powerful but easy-to-use GUI.


Important to Know
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over the years, I've learned that I need to make this clear:

 *If part of the system does not seem to work right, let us
know! Do not assume that it must remain that way.*
