*Notes and Examples* The PUSH command stores the whole DRAW
attribute settings (including matrix and pen settings) into the stack.
You can then change the current transformation matrix, pens etc. inside
the PUSH command block but all commands AFTER the PUSH command block
will use the attribute setup setup stored by the PUSH command.
