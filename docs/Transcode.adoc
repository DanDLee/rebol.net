The TRANSCODE function translates strings to values one "token" at a
time.


Purpose
~~~~~~~

In R3, the LOAD function is a mezzanine. This creates a problem for
LOAD/next, which is a native operation. To solve the problem, TRANSCODE
was added. This is a low level source-to-value translator.

Note that normal translation of source code is performed in LOAD by TO
BLOCK!, not by TRANSCODE.


Usage
~~~~~

 USAGE: TRANSCODE source

DESCRIPTION: Translates code/data from string into value. Returns [value
next-source]. TRANSCODE is a native value.
