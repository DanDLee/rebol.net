*In a nutshell, UTF-8 encodes unicode strings into a sequence of bytes.
A single codepoint ("char") may be encoded as a single byte, two bytes,
or up to as many as six bytes.*


General Benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* UTF-8 is the most common unicode standard and is widely supported by
most systems, servers, tools, editors, and other utilities.
* When treated as a stream of bytes, UTF-8 strings can be handled even
by systems that do not know of their encoding. (For example, C-libs that
use zero as a terminating character.)
* UTF-8 also has the advantage that existing ASCII (ANSI) strings that
use chars with values less than 128 remain as they are. This allows many
existing REBOL script to be run exactly as they are now, without
modification or specification of their encoding.
* All unicode codepoints can be represented in UTF-8 (even those outside
of a 16 bit range).

R3 will support a range of conversions to and from UTF-8 and the popular
character encodings.

See the Unicode page for details.


Encoding Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of how the word préfére would be encoded as UTF-8:

 1
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 
pr
&eacute;f&eacute;re
 70  72  C3  A9 
 66  C3  A9  72  65
