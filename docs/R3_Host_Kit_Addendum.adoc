A107 10-September-2010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Depending on your toolchain, the makefile in the Linux A107 Host Kit
may need a fix for A107 to build, as first noted by Andreas: add
-ldl to LIBS in line 16.


A104 26-August-2010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The makefile needs a minor fix for A104 to build, as first noted by
Adrian. See http://www.curecode.org/rebol3/ticket.rsp?id=1643[bug#1643]
for a fix to work around this.

Building the Host Kit on Win32 using MinGW
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Download the
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/MinGW%205.1.6/MinGW-5.1.6.exe/download[MinGW
5.1.6 installer] and install _as admin_ (preferably to
c:\mingw, but see the note below)
* Add mingw\bin to the windows command path
* Download the R3 A102 Host Kit for Windows and unpack
* Open a normal Windows command prompt, change to the unpacked host kit
directory
* Copy mingw32-make.exe from mingw\bin to the host kit
directory as make.exe
* Run make
* Test the r3.exe built by running r3 go.r

_Note_: the default makefile supplied with the hostkit assumes that
mingw is installed to c:\mingw. The directory path is at the
top of the makefile so you can easily edit it there .. there's only one
occurrence.


Building the Host Kit using Code::Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Download the
http://prdownload.berlios.de/codeblocks/codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe[Code::Blocks
10.05 MingW installer] and install
* Download the R3 A102 Host Kit for Windows and unpack
* Download http://www.rebol.cz/r3/host-kit/r3.cbp[Cyphre's project file]
and store it where you unpacked the host kit
* Start the Code::Blocks IDE and open the r3.cbp
