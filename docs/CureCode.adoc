For bug reports and enhancement requests.


Summary
~~~~~~~

For 3.0 bug reporting and enhancement requests we use *CureCode*,
written and hosted by http://softinnov.org/[Softinnov].

The web site interface can be found at http://curecode.org/rebol3/


Basics
~~~~~~

It's pretty obvious when you look at it.

*No account is needed* to view and search tickets.

*To submit or change a ticket requires an account.* But, it is easy and
fast http://curecode.org/rebol3/register.rsp[to register] (also via the
link at the top of the page.)

You can also modify the state of tickets that you've submitted earlier.


Questions
~~~~~~~~~

* Q:
** Does it have a REBOL interface?
** Although it runs in REBOL via the Cheyenne web server, there is
currently no direct REBOL interface, but there are plans to add it
later.
* Q:
** Can it be enhanced?
** Several enhancements have already been made, and you can submit your
suggestions to Softinnov. In addition, the source code is available, so
you can help with bugs and enhancements.
