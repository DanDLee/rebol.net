 In an effort to make the wiki a coherent
document, some pages were canobilized to a high degree. No conclusions
should be drawn regarding a contribution that finds its way to the
Vault. Often, the issues described here have been duplicated in other
works. Whats placed in the vault and what is not is often determined by
the order of the issues reviewed.
