Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have learned a lot over the last 6 years of using VID. We have
learned not only the strengths of the dialect approach to describing
graphical user interfaces, but also some of the weaknesses when there is
perhaps too much freedom for new users.

*This project is to design a new VID for REBOL 3.* Yes, we have limited
time to build it, but I think we have a good idea what we want, and how
best to construct it. That is the advantage of 6 years of experience.

It should be noted that there are a few alternative approaches to VID in
the world today: RebGUI, GLayout, and others. We need to examine those
designs closely to find ideas that may be of benefit in VID 3. For
example, the RebGUI dialect is more regular, making it simpler for
users. That may be a good thing, and we may want to do that.

I have no strict requirement as to how we implement VID 3, and if
synergy or collaboration with other projects is possible, we should take
that into account. However, in the end, it is us that must be satisfied.
Only with that will VID 3 go far.

*And finally, this is a _draft document_, and I am sure that I missed a
number of important areas.* If something is missing, don't make any
assumptions about that. It could be a mistake. We can update the
document to include it.


General Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a short summary of the top level goals for VID 3. I know each of
these sounds rather general, but each one is deeply significant to me.
For this document, I will refrain from a deep analysis of the importance
of each one.

VID 3 must be:

* *Powerful* - to create most types of GUIs used in modern applications.
* *Clean* - less cluttered and "more regular" dialect format.
* *Simpler* - less complex implementation method.
* *Fast* - very fast at layout, display, and update.
* *Small* - no program bloat and a smaller memory footprint (than R2).
* *Pretty* - we need an updated graphical look and some level of skins.

Of course, stated again for emphasis, the ultimate requirement is that
we must be satisfied with the new VID design and implementation.


Dialect Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although there are a few small changes that we should make, I think the
general syntax for VID has been good.


General Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The syntax in pseudo PARSE format is:

`   ANY [ var: [ command | style ] ]`

where command is:

`   command-word ANY args`

and style is:

`   style-name ANY [ attribute | keyword-option ]`


Command-Word
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commands are keywords of the VID dialect. They have the highest
precedence in context (meaning you cannot use a style that has a command
name). See the section below for more.


Style-Name
^^^^^^^^^^

A style-name is also a word, but it is part of a different context then
commands. A list of standard styles is provided later in this document.


Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

A attribute is a datatype that specifies a modification to a style.

In this example:

`   text "This is a line"`

the quoted string is an attribute of the type STRING!, and the TEXT
style understands its meaning.

This form is similar to that of functions, so it is quite natural for
users. Where it differs from functions is that the datatype order is not
position dependent, so users need not care about that detail.

You are free to write:

`   text "This is a line" bold`

or

`   text bold "This is a line"`

The datatypes allowed for attributes are:

* integer - width in pixels
* percent - width in terms of the bounding panel
* pair - size of style
* string - text of style
* tuple - a color for style
* logic - an initial state
* file - a file link or source location
* URL - a URL link or source location
* block - action code or sub-layout
* image - an image as style background
* word - a keyword such as BOLD or CENTER
* paren - a computation

There may be a few others that I missed. Let's add them.


Options
^^^^^^^

An option is a special keyword followed by a specification block.

For example:

 image effect [colorize blue]

`   text-list data list-values` `
