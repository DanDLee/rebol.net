Basic Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*R3 supports Unicode character strings.* Unicode provides the ability to
handle text from all languages, worldwide.

For REBOL 3.0, Unicode is limited mainly to basic operations and does
not support the full range of conditions and variations of the Unicode
standard. However, what is supported will go far toward helping your
programs handle text from around the world.

It's important to know a few basic rules about Unicode, because they may
effect your programs. Here is a very short summary to get you started:

1.  If your code, data, and OS are always ANSI (ASCII 7 bits), then you
can ignore most of the special Unicode rules. R3 will keep ANSI strings
optimized to conserve memory.
2.  If any of your code, data, and OS are Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), then the
main thing you need to know is that your files should be UTF8 encoded.
All other operations should work as in #1 above.
3.  If your code and data are ANSI or Latin-1, but your OS runs in
Unicode mode, things should also work fine. R3 will use the necessary
Unicode interfaces (wide char or UTF8 APIs) to your OS for things like
directories and files.
4.  If your code is ANSI or Latin-1, but your data could include
Unicode, there are a small number of rules that you will need to know.
Mainly, you should know that that strings in R3 automatically handle
Unicode, and when doing file or network transfers, binary data is not
equivalent to string data; it must be converted. Also, there can be some
details related to search and sort to know. See more below.
5.  If your code, data, and OS are Unicode, then R3 will handle that.
For example, a string is still as string, even if it contains Unicode
characters. But, you will need to know the above rule and a few more
rules about encodings.
6.  Finally, if you use a non-Unicode OS, but you use Unicode code or
data, the script should still operate correctly; however, your console
may display odd characters that are not supported by your OS or console
font.

In addition, if you are accustomed to using codepages (upper-half of
8-bit chars) for character encoding, R3 supports those as conversions
during read and write, but internal storage does not use codepage
techniques. Internally, storage is Unicode, or Latin-1, the low order
8-bit subset of Unicode. Of course, you don't need to know any of that,
but it does provide memory optimizations compared to other programming
languages.


Basic Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few examples will help you quickly understand the general idea of
Unicode in REBOL.

Here we use the Greek character alpha (&alpha;), which you can see in
this
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Programming/Unicode/Character_reference/0000-0FFF>[handy
Unicode table] is character U+03B1, or 945 as integer. We use this
character for the example because it is far beyond the Latin-1 8-bit
range.

 >> #"^(3B1)" ; char as a hex encoded literal == #"α"

>> to-char #3b1 == #"α"

>> to-char 945 == #"α"

>> "testα" == "testα"

>> "test^(3b1)" ; string containing hex char literal == "testα"

>> str: append "test" to-char 945 == "testα"

>> length? str == 5

>> last str == #"α"

>> to-binary str == #\{74657374CEB1} ; note, it is UTF-8 encoded!

>> to-string to-binary str ; to UTF-8 and back again == "testα"

>> uppercase str == "TESTΑ"

>> testα: 10 == 10

>> testα == 10

>> write %testα.txt "example" == port!

>> read %. == [%abc.r %testα.txt] 

Of course, if we use an eastern character, what I see in my console is
just a box; no character is rendered because it's not available in the
current font. However, if I cut and paste it here:

 >> #"^(905)" == #"अ" 

You will see the character in the browser (if your current browser font
supports it). So it's correct value is being preserved, even if it does
not display properly.

Source Code Encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*The default R3 source code encoding is UTF-8.*

Other encodings such as the popular Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) are supported,
but such encodings must be specified in the script header, as an
argument to the LOAD function, or as a command line argument in REBOL.


Header specification of encoding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script headers can specify the encoding of the script. For example:

 REBOL [ encoding: latin-1 ]
