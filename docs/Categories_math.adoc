|[multiblock cell omitted] |Returns the first value multiplied by the
second.

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Returns the first number raised to the
second number.

|&plus;]] |Returns the result of adding two values.

|-]] |Returns the second value subtracted from the first.

|/]] |Returns the first value divided by the second.

|//]] |Returns the remainder of first value divided by second.

|abs]] |Returns the absolute value.

|absolute]] |Returns the absolute value.

|add]] |Returns the result of adding two values.

|and]] |Returns the first value ANDed with the second.

|arccosine]] |Returns the trigonometric arccosine in degrees.

|arcsine]] |Returns the trigonometric arcsine in degrees.

|arctangent]] |Returns the trigonometric arctangent in degrees.

|complement]] |Returns the one's complement value.

|cosine]] |Returns the trigonometric cosine in degrees.

|divide]] |Returns the first value divided by the second.
