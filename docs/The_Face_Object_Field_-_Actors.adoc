Actors
^^^^^^

The *actors* field of the compound object of a face is a map of the
functions that define the behavior of the face. Whenever an event or
other action occurs, these are the functions that handle it. (In some
GUI systems, these are called _interactors_.)

If a style object is derived from a parent style, the parent actors are
inherited from the parent object. But the derived actors are not bound
to the parent. This allows the functions of the actor to be more
efficiently reused in all instances of the face. Within an actor, a
reference to a facet is made via special access functions.

*Typical actors are:* 

* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-make[on-make]* - when face
is first created to initialize special values
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-click[on-click]* - when
mouse button clicked on face
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-drag[on-drag]* - when
dragging inside a face
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-drag-over[on-drag-over]* -
when dragging and are over a target face
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-drop[on-drop]* - when drag
has stopped or when a file is dropped
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-focus[on-focus]* - when we
have been given or are losing focus
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-get[on-get]* - to fetch
state values
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-set[on-set]* - when state
values are set
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-clear[on-clear]* - when the
state values are cleared
* *link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-key[on-key]* - when key has
been pressed (for our focus)
