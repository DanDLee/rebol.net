REBOL pairs are commonly used to represent positions or sizes of objects
in two-dimensional graphic layouts. They are implemented as pairs of
32-bit floating point values in the newest versions of R3 and
interpreted as representing the coordinates in pixels.


Why the subpixel resolution is needed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  REBOL display engine uses AGG, which supports positions precise to 1
/ 256 pixel, therefore it is not reasonable to limit ourselves to less
precise input, than the graphic engine already supports
2.  For scaling, we need higher precision, than what we can display,
since if we rescale a picture doubling its size, former difference of
0.5 pixel becomes 1 pixel difference
3.  When displaying the picture on a different medium than the display,
higher resolution is needed for the picture to look good
4.  Current R3 GUI resizing already uses subpixel pair resolutions to
maintain higher accuracy in some cases

The alternatives that were considered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These were proposed as possible alternatives, before the FP pair variant
prevailed:


Using the integer pair implementation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It may be a surprise for many, but, actually, we don't even have to
change the implementation of REBOL pair to achieve subpixel accuracy.
The only thing we have to do is define, how REBOL pairs are interpreted.
If we state, that REBOL pairs are interpreted as dimensions in
subpixels, where every subpixel is e.g. a 1 / 65536 of a pixel (later on
I shall explain, why this "magic number" looks reasonable to me), then
we are done, no other pair implementation change is totally necessary.


How to load, mold, form pairs with subpixel accuracy?

To support the subpixel accuracy we can adjust the LOAD, MOLD, FORM
functions to take the subpixel interpretation into account. This is how
we can modify the LOAD function to accept two decimal coordinates X and
Y for a pair:

; this defines the interpretation (accuracy) of the pair:
subpixel-count: 65536 load-pair: func [ \{convert decimal coordinates to
subpixels} x [number!] y [number!] ] [ return (x * subpixel-count + 0.5
* 1x0) + (y * subpixel-count + 0.5 * 0x1) ] mold-pair: func [ \{mold a
subpixel accuracy pair to a "human readable" form} s [pair!] \{a
subpixel-accuracy pair} ] [ rejoin [round/to s/x / subpixel-count
0.000015 "x" round/to s/y / subpixel-count 0.000015] ]
;example usage

a 123.45x678.90 pair::

load-pair 123.45 678.90 ; == 8090419x44492390 (this would be the
"internal representation") mold-pair 8090419x44492390 ; ==
"123.45x678.9"
