These are notes for link:R3_GUI[R3 GUI] alpha testers.


It Works, but...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GUI works. The primary design achieves most of my goals, although it
still has some rough edges.

*Keep in mind you are using an _alpha_.*

This means it will have some problems and will crash at times. Some of
these problems we know about, others we don't.

Also, if you are using variations of the GUI done by anyone but me,
_they are experimental prototypes_' and may have other problems. They
may also contain concepts that may or may not be in the final design,
since they still have to pass the Carl filter.

So, my advice in general is, *not to worry*. We will fix everything. We
are committed to this being a powerful but easy-to-use GUI.


Important to Know:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over the years, I've learned that I need to make this clear:

 *If part of the system does not seem to work right, let us
know! Do not assume that it must remain that way.* 

For example, we still have some problems with resizing various panels.
Part of this is from incorrect default settings for styles. Maybe its
min-size or max-size is not correct. Other problems may be from bugs.
But, if it looks wrong, assume that it is wrong.

Now, if you point to a problem, and we don't think it's a problem, that
means either:

1.  We did not document it well enough.
2.  You did not read part that documentation.
3.  We disagree on the design.

The first two are easy to fix. The third may require that we talk about
it. It is likely we have different goals. Discussion is required.


Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

Steps:

1.  *Login* to the AltME world.
2.  The main GUI source code is in the *source/* directory.
3.  R3 is *view.exe* in that same source/ dir.
4.  Drag *main.r* onto view.exe to test it.

Setup your editor to run view.exe for your script (to save you time).


How to try it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start with:

 REBOL []

do %load-gui.r

view [ title "It works!" button "Ok" quit ]
