Style
^^^^^


*Face/style* is the name of the style, not the style object. It's
implemented this way mainly for debugging reasons: if you print the
face, you don't have to see the entire style specification, which can be
fairly long.  For example, a button object would
have:

` style: 'button`

The map between style names and their definitions is stored in the main
module object for the GUI system. New styles can be added to this map as
needed.
