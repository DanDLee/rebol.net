This document describes the new map datatype.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

A map is a key-to-value associative array. It uses hashing for high
performance. Sometimes this kind of association is also referred to as a
dictionary.

The map datatype replaces the R2 hash datatype. The motivation for this
replacement was that some people in the user community felt the design
of the older hash datatype was confusing, since it hashed both keys and
their data. The new map datatype just hashes keys. Data is not hashed.


Keys
~~~~

The map datatype lets you attach _keys_ to data values. It is more
efficient than a block or object (when words as keys are unbound) once
you have more than a couple dozen keys.

A key can be any type of word or string. Other datatypes are not allowed
at this time.

Note that when a string is used for a key:

* the dataype of the string is also part of the key. For example, the
string "test" is not the same as the file name %test or the issue #test.
* the string is copied into the map. It is not by reference. This
prevents the problem where a string is modified after the association
has been made.

Map allows integers as keys. They are not indexes.

`   >> m: make map! [x a 1 b 2 c 3 y]` +
`   == make map! [x a 1 b 2 c 3 y]` +
`   >> m/2` +
`   == c`


Values
~~~~~~

The value associated with a key can be any datatype. For example, you
can associate a key that happens to be a word with a file name, a block,
an object, or even a graphics object.

Note that series and other complex datatype values are stored by
reference. That means that they can be modified outside of the map
structure.


Actions
~~~~~~~

You can access a map using paths or action functions.

The paths allowed are:

* dict/word - get a value for that key (or return NONE if no such word)
* dict/word: - set a value for that key, or creating it if necessary

These action functions are currently supported:

* make
* to
* pick
* select (same as pick)
* poke
* length
* equal?
* not-equal?
* append
* insert (same as append)

In addition TO-BLOCK, TO-OBJECT, FORM and MOLD will work for map types.


General Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General usage has been kept very simple -- to be on par (or better) with
what other scripting languages offer.

Here is an example that shows the most common usage patterns:

 d: make map! 1000

`   d/test: 10` +
`   print d/test` +
`   10`

`   print d/notest` +
`   none`

`   d/test: 20` +
`   print d/test` +
`   20` `
