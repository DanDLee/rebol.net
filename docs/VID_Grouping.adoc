VID Grouping Explained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VID layout flow is based on GROUP, similar to an HTML table. Cells are
aligned; all cells within a column are the same width and within a row,
cells are all the same height.


Sizing
^^^^^^

The cell sizing includes:

* _natural_ size; *face/size*.
* _shrink_, how much a face can shrink; *face/shrink*
* _stretch_, how much a face can stretch; *face/stretch*. See
VID:_Skin_creation_guide#SIZE.2C_SHRINK_and_STRETCH[Shrink and Stretch]
for a diagram and description of this powerful layout feature.

There is a sequence of events that occur to determine the _natural_ size
that includes resizing to maintain consistent hieght and width of cell
rows and columns. With the shrink and stretch controls, default layouts
remain consistent across window resizing while allowing for fine tuning.

The styles *BLANK* (size: 0x0 - little stretch and shrink), *PAD* (size:
24x24, subject to change - same stretch and shrink as BLANK) and *FILL*
(size: 100x100 - lots of stretch) all assist in this fine tuning.
