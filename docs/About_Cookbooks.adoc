Why Cookbooks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is highly recommended to take notes of any kind related to REBOL that
are easily lost or forgotten and store it in DocBase. However, since
DocBase is normally very strict with what is appropriate to put there,
the Cookbooks section in DocBase is the place to put things that don't
fit into the rest of DocBase. The criteria that makes for a Cookbook is
loosely:

* It should be a REBOL related topic that is hard to describe in a few
words.
* It should be important information that does not fit into the rest of
DocBase, such as implementation notes for a protocol, scheme or
algorithm or how to perform a lengthy procedure or things that are
tricky to do in REBOL.
* You can also discuss features about a particular product built in
REBOL or produce a tutorial for it.

The best example is really just to look at the current list of cookbook
titles and see, if your documentation will fit.

*Cookbooks are made to insure that such important information is not
scattered or lost.* We've suffered in the past with many websites
containing vital REBOL information that are moved or lost. This
information becomes hard to find over time, so the Cookbook list is
going to be the primary source of such information. You are highly
encouraged to use it!


Making a Cookbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Cookbook is a list of *recipes*. Cookbooks are divided into areas of
interest, such as *Networking*, *Lowlevel Graphics*, *Highlevel
Graphics* or *Data Processing*. More can be added as seen fit.

The list of Cookbooks is avaliable link:Cookbooks[here].


Making a Recipe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a Cookbook recipe, simply create a page with any title in DocBase.
Add the template  at the top of the document. Then add
the document page name in the link:Cookbooks[Cookbook list] and then
link to it from there.

To initiate a new DocBase page, the easiest way is to type your
preferred page title into the Search field of the DocBase Navigation
section and press Go.

While not totally necessary, cookbooks should start with the
 template. This template accepts 4 parameters. A
*title*, an *author*, a difficulty *level* and a *category*.

* title does not need to be the same as the page title. Use something
short and snappy. If not included a generic *REBOL Recipe* will be used.
* author would be what ever credit you would like. If not included
*Incognito* will be used.
* level is a number from 1 to 3. 1 matches _Beginner_, 2 for
_Intermediate_ and 3 for _Advanced_. *2* is default.
* category should be Tip, Code, Networking, Data Processing etcetera.
Defaults to *Code*.
