The DOC Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The DOC style is a simple rich-text document markup method
to easily format the text of display notes, instructions, and comments.

The DOC style uses the same basic rules as REBOL'S *MakeDoc*.

Examples may be found by running *Demo* at the R3 console, then "Run
Test"
