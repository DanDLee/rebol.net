This document specifies the R3 I/O port functions.


Important conceptual changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some fundamental changes have been made to ports.

1.  Ports default to binary, not to string.
2.  String ports expect an encoding for read and write.
3.  By default, the string encoding is UTF-8, but others are allowed.
4.  String terminators are converted as well. REBOL strings default to
LF.


READ is binary by default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you open a port (or read or write on an unopened file or URL), if
you do not specify an encoding, the port will be opened as binary by
default.

For example:

` data: read %file`

will return data as a binary value, as sequence of raw bytes. No
conversion is done.

*The main benefit is that non-textual files, such as images and sounds,
will not be corrupted in this default case.* We are trading a bit of
ease-of-use for safety. It is a good trade.

To read the file as a string:

` data: read/string %file`

The file will be decoded into a string using some simple rules about the
encoding:

1.  If the file starts with a byte order marker (BOM), then that
encoding will be applied.
2.  If the file has no BOM, then UTF-8 is expected. Note that UTF-8
includes, without conversion, ASCII (7-bit chars), but not Latin-1.

See more about READ options below.


WRITE depends on datatype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you write to a port, file, or URL, the default is to use binary as
well:

`  write %file data`

It is also possible to write it as a string:

`  write/string file data`

However, this is not required. REBOL knows the datatype of the content
data and will do the right thing for binary and string. So, WRITE will
auto-encode the content, using the default encoding (UTF-8).

See more about WRITE options below.


Effect on common idiom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The above change has an impact the line conversion method we often use
in REBOL. The code:

`  write %file2 read %file1`

*no longer converts line terminators* (e.g. CRLF). Instead, this line
must be used:

`  write %file2 read/string %file1`

This tells READ to decode the file into a string. Note that the WRITE
does not require a /string refinement, because it is being provided with
a string datatype. The default encoding is applied.


Definition of READ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The READ function is currently defined as:

 USAGE: READ source /binary /string /as encoding /lines /part size
/skip length

DESCRIPTION: Reads from a port, file, or URL. READ is an action value.

ARGUMENTS: source (port! file! url! block!)

REFINEMENTS: /binary -- Read as bytes, no conversion /string -- Read as
string, encoded from BOM, default to UTF-8, converts terminators /as --
Read using the given encoding, such as UTF-8 encoding -- BOM UTF-8
UTF-16LE UTF-16BE ASCII LATIN-1 CR LF CRLF (word! block!) /lines -- Read
as strings, splitting into a block of lines /part -- Read a specified
number of bytes (not chars) size (number!) /skip -- Skip a number of
bytes (not chars) length -- Byte offset, negative end offset, or 'end
(number!)
