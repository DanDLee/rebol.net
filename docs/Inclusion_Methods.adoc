This is a discussion area for _converging_ on what we want to include in
R3 for inclusion methods.


Goal
~~~~

Our goal is to finalize what we need in REBOL to support inclusion of
code components both at run-time, but also at application build time
(for apps that use that method.)

Developers can:

* Edit sections below, or add new ones as needed. *Just make it clear
what you are proposing.*
* Discuss this on R3 chat.
* For special notes that don't belong on this page, but we don't want to
lose them in chat, add them via discussion link above.


General Needs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are the primary requirements:

1.  Enable programs to include (execute) other functions and code.
2.  Enable programs to include (load into memory) other data, such as
databases, media (images, sounds, etc.).
3.  The ability to build distributable programs that include the above
within their distribution unit (as a .r file or encapped
executable).
4.  Testing support - the ability to run a distributable program during
its development cycle.
5.  To support PITL encapsulating parts of the program.
6.  Comfort - use a search path.
7.  Comments - an ability to either keep or strip comments from the
built application.
8.  Standardization - provide a standard, not forcing the usage of ad
hoc methods.

Standardization is a key element. Without it, there is no easy way to
create public areas where code can be easily shared and used by others.
It also means we'll each continue to build our own solutions that fill
very common needs. E.g., a MAKE system. Finally, if we ever want to move
towards true PitL, or have an IDE, we will have to address the need for
some kind of project definition. Without standards for how resources are
included, and systems are built and deployed, we can't do that.


Survey of Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


DO
^^

It is common to use DO to include other code files in a program.

`  do %file1.r` +
`  do %file2.r` +
`  if something [do %file3.r]`


How it satisfies the needs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Can execute other functions and code.
2.  No direct support for data inclusion, data have to be wrapped is
some way (ad hoc method).
3.  No direct support for distributable unit building, building scripts
have to exist (ad hoc method).
4.  No direct support for distributable unit testing, two-step process
is necessary (ad hoc method):
1.  Build the application.
2.  Test-run it.
5.  No direct encapsulation support, ad hoc methods are available.
6.  No direct search path support.
7.  No flexible comment support.


Tradeoffs
+++++++++

The advantages are:

* Very simple. Easy to debug.
* Evaluates code. It can do anything, including loading other scripts,
setting up environments, defining functions, etc.

The disadvantages are:

* It happens at run-time - so you must have access to all the listed
files.
* It is evaluated, so must be in code format with a header. Therefore,
if files contain data, they must be wrapped and assigned to a variable
(or returned as a result).
* Uncomfortable - no automatic file search using a search path
* Incompatible with PREBOL (ignores PREBOL directives)


LOAD
^^^^

The LOAD function is often used instead of DO. For example, to load data
files.

`   data: load %data.r`

It is also used often to build distributions, using this simple method:

`   files: [` +
`       %file1.r` +
`       %file2.r` +
`       ...` +
`   ]` +
`   code: []` +
`   foreach file files [append code load file]` +
`   save %program.r code`

It turns out, _this is how the programs that run most RT tools and
websites are built_.

Is it scalable (PITL)? Yes, the primary REBOL releases are all built
using this approach, with a few minor variations.


How it satisfies the needs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Does not execute code.
2.  It can be only a part of the solution, since it does not include
anything into anything. Does not support all mentioned part types.
3.  Does not actually build, special code (script) is necessary.
4.  Does not execute and therefore does not test.
5.  Does not encapsulate.
6.  Does not use a search path.
7.  Does not support on-demand strippable comments.


Tradeoffs
+++++++++

The advantages are:

* Very simple. Easy to debug.
* Builds a single distro file as a result.

The disadvantages are:

* No control beyond that of including the file itself.
* Doesn't provide any standards. Every scenario is ad hoc.


Modules: IMPORT function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REBOL 3.0 method of dynamically including modules in a program at
runtime.

Summary of usage:

`   import 'module    ; converts to .r and will use search path` +
`   import %module.r  ; will use search path` +
`   import `http://www.rebol.com/module.r[`http://www.rebol.com/module.r`]

Imported modules are fully encapsulated when loaded. Exported functions
are controlled via an export list (see below).

The search path for finding modules can include local directories as
well as HTTP URLs. In addition, version requirements can be specified.


How it satisfies the needs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Executes code.
2.  Does not support fine-grained inclusion.
3.  Does not build distributable applications.
4.  Does not test distributable applications.
5.  Encapsulates.
6.  Uses search path.
7.  Does not support on-demand strippable comments.


Tradeoffs
+++++++++

Advantages:

* A real module system for PITL.
* Proper encapsulation.
* More powerful than LOAD or DO (e.g. use of search paths).
* Supports global options (e.g. search paths and which modules to
include by default).
* Supports module options specified at runtime at point of call,
overriding what the module specifies.
* Can import a module by reference, rather than binding its exported
words to your context.
* The import specification can be a full dialect.
* Most script programmers are familiar with this method (PERL, Python,
Ruby, etc.)

Disadvantages:

* More complex and more difficult to debug.
* Dynamically imported words have to be bound at runtime, which can only
be done safely under specific circumstances, or manually with BIND or
IN.
* Dynamically exported words can't be determined without running the
code in the module, which might not be safe. This makes the analysis and
sandboxing tools difficult to make.
* The limits of dynamic import/export would be confusing to people
familiar with modular languages.
* Not usable for building distributions using INCLUDE method.
* Hence, no fine-grained inclusion control (like PREBOL, below).


Modules: IMPORTS and EXPORTS headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REBOL 3.0 method of including modules in a program at LOAD time.

Summary of usage:

`   REBOL [type: module imports: ['module]]   ; converts to .r and will use search path` +
`   REBOL [type: module imports: [%module.r]] ; will use search path` +
`   REBOL [type: module imports: `http://www.rebol.com/module.r[`1`]`]` +
`   REBOL [type: module exports: [myfunc myobject]] ; Exported words.` +
`   REBOL [type: module exports: all] ; Export all locally set words.`

Imported modules are fully encapsulated when loaded. Exported words are
controlled via an export list.

The search path for finding modules can include local directories as
well as HTTP URLs. In addition, version requirements can be specified.


Tradeoffs
+++++++++

Advantages:

* A real module system for PITL.
* Proper encapsulation - all local words can be captured.
* More powerful than LOAD or DO (e.g. use of search paths).
* LOAD and DO can handle this for you, automatically (and already do).
* Supports global options (e.g. search paths and which modules to
include by default).
* Supports module options specified in the module's own header.
* The import and export headers can be a full dialect.
* Can optionally include a module by name, rather than binding its
exported words to your context.
* Binding can be resolved at LOAD time, when it is safe.
* Headers can be used by distribution builders like PREBOL.
* Headers can be used by analysis code without tracing.
* Can be used to sandbox REBOL code for safe execution.
* Can be backported to REBOL 2 (and mostly has been already by
Gabriele).
* Most modular code programmers are familiar with this method.

Disadvantages:

* More complex. Unknown global options can make it difficult to debug.
* Dynamic management of imports and exports would need to be done by a
distribution builder like PREBOL, or at runtime with the IMPORT
function.
* The limits of static import/export would be confusing to new
programmers unfamiliar with PITL.


PREBOL
^^^^^^

The REBOL SDK introduced a method called PREBOL (REBOL preprocessing).

This method uses the ISSUE! datatype (which is rarely used in code
itself) as a type of markup.

`   #include %file.r` +
`   #include %file.r`


How it satisfies the needs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Does not execute code.
2.  Supports fine-grained inclusion.
3.  Builds distributable applications.
4.  Does not execute and therefore testing has to be a two-step process:
1.  Build application.
2.  Execute the built application.
5.  The approach described in
INCLUDE_documentation#Context_encapsulation can be used.
6.  Does not use a search path.
7.  Does not support on-demand strippable comments.


Tradeoffs
+++++++++

Advantages:

* Finer grained inclusion than LOAD or DO.
* Greater control over what is and is not included because it can
evaluate expressions at processing time.
* Familiar in concept (and even in appearance) to C/C++ and other
language users (but not identical in semantics.)
* Can be extended to support modules, if imports and exports are
specified in headers.

Disadvantages:

* More complex and more difficult to debug.
* Not very Rebolish. Introduces a new meta-syntax, and although it is a
valid REBOL dialect, it's really outside the original symbolic
intentions of the language (because it uses #issues which are series,
not symbolic words.)


PREBOL (INCLUDE dialect) keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the usage of #issue values as dialect keywords is undesirable, there
is still a variant to use words. They just need to be somewhat
"outstanding" to make them immediately visible and to suppress the
probability, that the keywords will be used for other, incompatible
purposes. For example, the INCLUDE function already took the
comment word (since it is highly unlikely that it can cause
any undesirable interference) as its keyword to support automatic
stripping of comments. The following alternatives look like being
available:

!include &include

* include

+include -include .include =include ?include ^include _include |include
`include ~include .include.

* include*
** include
