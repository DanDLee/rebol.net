This is a preliminary document to specify the semantics of COPY for A80.
This also applies to MAKE object! which preforms a COPY as a default
action.


How values are effected by copying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a copy of a block or object is made, the copy operation handles
various datatypes differently:

* *immediate* values - these are always copied (integer! decimal! logic!
etc.)
* *indirect* values - can be copied if so desired (string! binary!
block! etc.)
* *restricted* values - cannot be copied (gob!, task!, port!)

It should be noted that restricted values aren't copied because they may
hold unique internal state data. For example, a gob is normally part of
a linked list, and to copy those linkage pointers destroys the list's
integrity.


Copy modes
~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few useful modes of copying:

* *shallow* - copy a block or object keeping all its values as
non-copied references (values are shared).
* *deep* - copy a block or object, then copy all its series values
(values are not shared).
* *all* - same as deep, but also copy all other copyable values such as
bitsets, vectors, images, maps, objects, errors, etc.
* *bind* - same as deep, but also copy functions and closures that will
be rebound in a new environment (this is a special mode used by MAKE
object!)

These modes are implemented in the COPY API with two refinements:

* COPY/types - specify as a typeset the values to be copied. Note that
you can use /types without /deep, in which case the copy is applied only
to the top level of values.
* COPY/deep - perform the copy recursively on each value. If you use
/deep without /types, it is assumed that you want to copy all series
values (any-string!, binary!, and any-block!) but not bitsets, images,
vectors, maps, functions, or objects.
