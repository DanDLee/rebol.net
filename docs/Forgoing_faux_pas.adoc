REBOL is a value-centric language. This can lead to some little
confusion with certain values and certain types. *none* is one of those
special cases.

` >> a: none` +
` == none` +
` >> type? a` +
` == none!`

So far so good. The source text _none_ when evaluated is the value
*none* and has a type of none!

` >> b: [none]` +
` == [none]` +
` >> a: first b` +
` == none` +
` >> type? a` +
` == word!`

Huh? This time the source text _none_ hasn't been evaluated (due to the
nature of how REBOL handles blocks ... the source has been loaded but
not yet evaluated ... a subtle but critical difference) so it's still
just a word, with a type of word!. There are few ways around this. All
link:#yesno[(well almost all)] REBOL values have what is
called a _lexical form_. These can be seen with *mold/all*. These
_serialized_ formats are what REBOL detects as the *load*able forms.

` >> a: none` +
` == none` +
` >> mold/all a` +
` == "#[none]"` +
` >> a: first [none]` +
` == none` +
` >> mold/all a` +
` == "none"`

This is a minor point, but the word _none_ (type word!) needs to be
evaluated to become the value *none* (type none!). So if you edit a
configuration file with a text editor and put in a _none_ thinking that
*none* is a good default and then LOAD the file, what gets loaded is a
_word!_. This word will test true inside an IF or EITHER expression,
even though it looks like *none*, it isn't; not yet. One way is to
evaluate the load with DO LOAD %file, but a safer REBOL way is to use
the _lexical form_, and avoid the DO. Practice safe computing; only *DO* what you know to be
good. The source text _#[none]_ is loaded by REBOL as the value
*none* with a type of none!, no ambiguity involved, for human or
computer.

This is true of all REBOL words, values and types; but _none_ can be a
little trickier when you are starting out.
