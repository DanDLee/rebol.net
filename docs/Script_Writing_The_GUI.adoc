 Domain Specific Dialecting. Doctors express their ideas in
medical terms, stockbrokers in trade terms, and quarterbacks in football
terms. Why? Because it's more efficient and productive. That's the
benefit of dialecting. Dialecting is the ability to create sub-languages
that provide you with extra leverage and productivity by expressing your
solutions in terms that are best suited to your purpose.

VID is REBOL's Visual Interface Dialect. A dialect is an extension of
the REBOL language that makes it easier to express or describe
information, actions, or interfaces. VID is a dialect that provides a
powerful method of describing user interfaces. 


General Syntax Of The Visual Interface Dialect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 GUI's are
created by specifying a series of faces and their attributes. The script
to the right illustrates the general syntax of a face written with the
VID dialect:  _variable: face inline-options_ OPTIONS _options_
'' actions'' 

* *variable* - used to refer to the face
* *face* - the type of the face to create (field, button, ...)
* *inline-options* - options, distinguished by datatype, listed in any
order. What options are specified by what datatype is dependend on how
the style parse the inline-options. And, it's not possible to have two
inline-options with the same datatype while keeping inline-options
positional independent.



* *options* - a block of less common options
* *actions* - specify special actions using keywords with data options

 The full syntax is not always
required. A variable name does not always have to be specified for
example.  Here are some examples to illustrate how
the syntax may be applied: 

::
  field
  +
  field "Enter Data"
  +
  field "Enter Data" options [area-color: sky]
  +
  field submit main-url
  +
  Customer-Address: field
  +
  Customer-Address: field "Enter Data" options [area-color: sky]

 "field" is an inbuilt *face*,
(_'field_ is it's style) "Enter Data", the field text as an *inline
option* "[area-color: sky]", field color as an *options block*
"submit main-url" is the *action* "Customer-Address" is the face
variable *variable, face, inline option, options block*


*Note:* _The images shown here with a temporary, prototype skin designed
for development purposes only._


Begin with Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just to provide a simple starting point, here's a GUI that consists of
two buttons:  Image:gui-basics-buttons.jpg

REBOL [ ]

::
  load-gui
  +
  view [
  +
  ;;
    button "REBOL" browse http://www.rebol.com
    +
    button "Close" close
  +
  ]

`  ` +
`  `



1.  *view* is a function that is given a block that constructs a *panel*
and displays it in a window.
2.  *button* is an in-built REBOL face.
3.  The buttons' text "REBOL" & "Close", are _inline options_ of the 2
faces.
4.  *browse* and *close* are the buttons' actions.



 REBOL scripts must have the header REBOL [ ].

If using the R3 alpha version, _load-gui_ must also be included in the
script to ensure the latest version will be downloaded and used.


To run a script, copy and paste the examples into a text file headed
with *REBOL [ ]*, include the load-gui function, and save this file with
a ".r" extension. Then either from the console type: do %example.r, or
drag the script file icon onto the REBOL file icon.  It should be noted that the *view* function is one of
several ways to construct GUIs. In addition to *view*, R3 will also
allow you to evaluate _GUI code directly_, similar to an HTML page.
Therefore, to make this document simpler, we could just write the
contents of the panel. For example, 

::
  button "REBOL" browse http://www.rebol.com
  +
  button "Quit" quit

 More on this later. 


Adding Faces
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the sake of illustration, let's toss in a few more faces and their
styles to the example:



::
  REBOL [ ]
  +
  load-gui
  +
  view [
  +
  ;;
    title "Opinion Survey"
    +
    text "Do you want programs to be easy to build?"
    +
    panel 2 [
    +
    ::
      label "Name:"
      +
      field
      +
      label "Comment:"
      +
      area
    +
    ]
    +
    group [
    +
    ::
      radio "Agree"
      +
      radio "Disagree"
      +
      radio "Not sure"
    +
    ]
    +
    check "Send me the results."
    +
    group [
    +
    ::
      button "Submit" submit http://www.rebol.net/cgi/submit.r
      +
      button "Reset" reset
      +
      button "Cancel" close
    +
    ]
  +
  ]

`  ` +
`  `Image:gui-basics-survey2.jpg[`216px`
`221px`]

 1. Several more faces (title, text, panel,
etc.) along with their options have been added. 2. Panels and
*groups* have been used to define the layout. A _group_ creates a
sub-panel within a panel. 3. No size information had to be added
to the script to display the faces.  4. The radio buttons automatically know how to exclude
each other when one is selected in the GUI. 5. And, when
clicked, the new _Submit_ and _Reset_ buttons respectively submit or
reset the text of the input fields of the panel to their initial
values. 




Another example

 REBOL [ ]
load-gui view [

::
  group 1 [
  +
  ;;
    sbar: scroller attach 'prog
    +
    prog: progress
  +
  ]
  +
  panel 80.200.180.80 [
  +
  ;;
    text "These attached faces SET the above scroller:"
    +
    slider attach 'sbar
    +
    scroller attach 'sbar
  +
  ]
  +
  group 3 [
  +
  ;;
    radio "Delta 10%" on set 'sbar 'delta 10%
    +
    radio "Delta 50%" set 'sbar 'delta 50%
    +
    radio "Delta 100%" set 'sbar 'delta 100%
    +
    button "Set 0%" set 'sbar 0%
    +
    button "Set 10%" set 'sbar 10%
    +
    button "Set 50%" set 'sbar 50%
    +
    button "Set 90%" set 'sbar 90%
    +
    button "Set 100%" set 'sbar 100%
    +
    button "Set 150%" set 'sbar 150%
  +
  ]
  +
  group 2 [
  +
  ;;
    bc: box-cross
    +
    scroller attach 'bc 'valy
    +
    scroller attach 'bc 'valx
  +
  ] options [spacer: -3x-3]

Here is another example that we use for the R3 GUI test program. It
tests the features of a scroll-bar, both on input from the user as well
as from other GUI objects.

It shows that a small amount of GUI code can make a useful panel.
