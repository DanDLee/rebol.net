The FOREACH function now allows you to access the series, not just the
values of the series. In other words, it blends the best of FORALL and
FOREACH.

This change also affects REMOVE-EACH and the new MAP function.

To refer to the series itself, you use a set word in the variables
block. This becomes a series reference. (The set-word notation is
consistent with that used in the parse dialect for a similar purpose.)

For example:

`>> data: [1 2 3 4]` +
`>> foreach [where: value] data [change where value + 1]` +
`>> data` +
`== [2 3 4 5]`

Here the WHERE: variable refers to the series, so the CHANGE modifies
the actual series block.

Note that the series reference does not advance the series index.
