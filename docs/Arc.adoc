The ARC command draws a partial section of an ellipse (or circle).

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Arg |Type |Description |Values
|center |[pair!] |The center of the circle |[multiblock cell omitted]

|radius |[pair!] |The radius of the circle |[multiblock cell omitted]

|angle-begin |[decimal!] |The angle where the arc begins, in degrees
|[multiblock cell omitted]

|angle-length |[decimal!] |The length of the arc in degrees
|[multiblock cell omitted]

|closed |[word!] |Optional, must be the word *closed* |*closed* - close
the arc
|=======================================================================

For angle-begin, 0° is to right of the center point,
on the horizontal axis.Arcs are drawn in a clockwise direction
from the angle-begin point.Simple open arcs,
beginning at 0°.

Simple open arcs, beginning at different angles, but all with
the same length.

*Closed Arcs*

A closed arc. The arcs is closed by drawing lines to the center point
of the circle that defines the arc.

Closed arcs are an easy way to draw wedges for pie charts.

By changing the center point, you can draw exploded pie
charts.
