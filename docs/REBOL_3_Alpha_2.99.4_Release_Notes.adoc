This is the readme file from the release distribution.


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~


What is it?
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an alpha release of REBOL 3.0.

An alpha release is an unfinished prototype. It contains many of the
features of the final product, but it is not final, and it is not a
product.

This is not a general release.

It is limited and we know that. So, please do not use it to control a
space station, power plant, or assembly line. This release is just for
you. It is not for re-distribution, not for review, nor for end users or
customers.


What is R3?
^^^^^^^^^^^

R3 has a long list of objectives, and here are a few of the main ones...

* multi-host environment model (with REBOL-in-a-DLL)
* open implementation of interfaces and subsystems
* module architecture (namespaces, multi-global contexts)
* unicode support (source encoding, string internals)
* plugin extension model (dynamic addition of natives)
* multitasking (isolated threading, system level sharing)
* 64 bit integers and functions
* arbitrary precision decimal (for money datatype)
* new graphical subsystem based on scalar vector graphics core (SVG)
* new port (I/O) model (async, streamlined, high performance)
* new evaluation and memory internals/methods
