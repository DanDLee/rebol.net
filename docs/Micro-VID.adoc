Micro-VID is a very simple dialect that can be used to create windows
without having to fiddle with GOBs directly.

It looks like VID although it's much simpler and uses the new fast
dialect method. Current available dialect words and styles are: _return,
at, size, button, h1, h2, text, image, slider_. Text styles can take a
string of text or a block of rich text dialect. A second block (or the
first block if you use a string for the text) can be used for the
action. Sizes currently need to be specified manually. (_return_ does
not do much either.)

Note that Micro-VID is here just for testing. Do not take it too
seriously. But I'm sure you'll find it useful.
