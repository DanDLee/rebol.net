Objective
~~~~~~~~~

Release the REBOL 3.0 Host Kit (host environment, including source code,
include files, and core library).


Release Stages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  [x] Core - Win32 host to initial developers (Dec-2)
2.  [x] Core - Posix hosts (Linux: Dec-12, OSX: ?, Others)
3.  [ ] View - experimental releases (draw, richtext, effects)
4.  [ ] View - final form, with updates to VID for any changes
5.  [ ] View - ports to Linux, OS X, etc. (from developers)
6.  [ ] Full release of *REBOL 3.0 Host Kit*


Development Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First stage:

* [x] Reconfigure for Core target (non-View, same as current posix
builds)
* [x] Build initial test host and lib
* [x] Debug host and lib
* [x] Review and update all host related include files
* [x] Merge host include files with lib includes (to stay sync'd, if
possible)
* [x] Update makefiles (script built)
* [x] Scan host sources for marker tags and review them
* [x] Rename lib function name prefixes? (do not use REBOL_)
* [x] Update host source headers

Second stage:

* [x] Modify build scripts for Posix and makefiles
* [x] Add .so support for Core lib
* [ ] Research the .so equivalent method on OS X

Future:

* Write and post OSLA (two kinds)
* Setup RebDev (R3 Chat) source archive area
* Modify build scripts for dual targets (core and view)
* Move Delect interfaces to Command! based interfaces
* Build view target
* Add more documentation, as needed
