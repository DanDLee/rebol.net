The TAKE function removes values from a series and returns them as a
result.


Concept
~~~~~~~

A common pattern found in queues and stacks is to remove a value,
returning the value as a result:

`   value: first series` +
`   remove series`

This code would return the value, and also remove it from the series.

The pattern is so common that R3 adds a new function, TAKE, that can be
used on all series datatypes. Using TAKE, the above example would be
reduced to just:

`   value: take series`

and, the result is the same as above.


Quick examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TAKE can be used with INSERT or APPEND to implement a number of stack
and queue methods. For example, a queue can be implemented as:

`   append stack value1` +
`   ...` +
`   value2: take stack`

And, with the TAKE/last refinement, a stack is implemented with:

`   append stack value1` +
`   ...` +
`   value2: take/last stack`


Usage
~~~~~

Help returns this information about TAKE:

 USAGE: TAKE value /part length /deep /last

DESCRIPTION: Copies and removes from series. (Modifies) TAKE is an
action value.

ARGUMENTS: value -- (Type: series! gob! port! none!)

REFINEMENTS: /part -- Limits to a given length or position length --
(Type: number! series! port! pair!) /deep -- Also copies series values
within the block /last -- Take it from the tail end
