The purpose of this document is to define the general parameters of
REBOL's run-time environment, and develop a better method of handling
QUIT (and related functions).


Environments Defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are four general environments for running REBOL programs. It is
best to clearly label them, so we can refer to them later:

1.  *Application* - run by user, not for debugging purposes, but to
achieve an end result
2.  *Server* - run by a server, not for debugging purposes, but to
achieve an end result
3.  *Shell* - run by a user, using REBOL as a shell to run a variety of
tasks that achieve an end result
4.  *Development* - run by developer, for debugging, education, or
experimentation by using the console.

We will include running as a browser (or embedded app) plugin as the
first case: an application. It is also possible that it may be run as a
plugin in the second case too.

In addition, we will define Console
