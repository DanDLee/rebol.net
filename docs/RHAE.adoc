This is the *REBOL Host Application Environment*. It is implemented as
an open source wrapper around the RRTE. It provides both the outer
environment for the RRTE as well as an API for RRTE OS and related
functions.

This architecture allows the RRTE to be embedded in other types of
applications, not just the standard REBOL program distribution or SDK.
