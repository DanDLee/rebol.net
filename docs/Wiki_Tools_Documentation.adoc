Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wiki Tools is a very small, but pretty powerful dialect for
communicating with a MediaWiki (MW) server, to remotely manipulate the
contents of a MW page or a series of pages. Wiki Tools has specifically
been created for use in link:Main_Page[REBOL 3 DocBase], but can be used
generally for MW sites.

Wiki Tools can:

1.  Upload single or multiple pages as MW pages.
2.  Download single or multiple pages as MW pages.
3.  Synchronize pages so that local or remotely stored pages are not
overwritten. This is based on the modification time of the local file or
the remote page.

The manual is itself uploaded to DocBase using Wiki Tools using the
following code:

` do-wiki [` +
`   login  ` +
`   upload "Wiki Tools Documentation"` +
`   logout` +
` ]`

Wiki Tools requires Cyphre's HTTP modification to handle cookies.

To download this file using Wiki Tools:

` do-wiki [` +
`   login  ` +
`   download "Wiki Tools Documentation"` +
`   logout` +
` ]`

And a file named *Wiki Tools Documentation.wiki* will be stored in the
same directory as Wiki Tools on your local machine.


Basics
~~~~~~

To connect and do operations on a MW server, you should use the
*DO-WIKI* function, which provides a simple dialect, called the
*MediaWiki Dialect* for this purpose:

` do-wiki [login upload text "== My Page ==" "My Page" logout]`

Wiki Tools keeps track of a few things, like, login information, if
you've logged in or which current work path has been set.

Therefore you can split operations up like this, if you desire:

` do-wiki [login  ]` +
` do-wiki [at %/my/wiki/files/]` +
` do-wiki [upload text "== My Page ==" "My Page"]` +
` do-wiki [upload text "== My Page 2 ==" "My Page 2"]` +
` do-wiki [logout]`

There's no speed difference between one big block or multiple blocks,
but can be meaningful, if you want to do custom error checking, between
specific operations.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the sources for MediaWiki is only available to the alpha
testers of REBOL 3, but they will be made widely available later.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Connecting
^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to a MW server, you must configure a few things in the WIKI
context:

` wiki/wpHost: server-name`

This should be the host name of the server to connect to, without
http://. So if your server is located at http://www.breadcrumb.com/ use:

` wiki/wpHost: "www.breadcrumb.com"`

and here it is:

` wiki/wpHost: "www.rebol.net"`

The path is the path to the index.php file that is used for editing
pages. This could be: http://www.breadcrumb.com/w/index.php?something.
You can see this path in the url of your webbrowser by selecting a MW
page, and click on the Edit Tab.

There is no default but standard is "w".

` wiki/wpPath: "w"`


Testing Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this set up, you can now test whether there is access to the
server, using:

` do-wiki [login "me" "mypassword"]`

If the response is:

` User 'me' logged into www.breadcrumb.com's MediaWiki.`

Then the server responds correctly and you can begin working with it.


Work Path
^^^^^^^^^

By default, Wiki Tools stores .wiki files downloaded from MW servers in
its own path. This can be changed by setting:

` wiki/work-path: %somepath/`

When working inside *do-wiki* you can set the work-path to different
locations, when uploading or downloading files.

` do-wiki [` +
`   at %upload-these-files/` +
`   upload "My Page 1" "My Page 2" "My Page 3"` +
`   at %downloaded-files/` +
`   download "Page 1" "Page 2" "Page 3"` +
` ]`


Time Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wiki Tools is very dependent on the time on the MW server and where Wiki
Tools runs, being synchronized, so Wiki Tools will know what the time is
on the server. This is because all data synchronization is time based,
and if those settings are incorrect, synchronization may be incorrect
and .wiki files may risk being overwritten with older data.
