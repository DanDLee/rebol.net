R3 provides two methods for implementing dialects. These two methods
have different goals.

1.  link:Internal_dialects[Internal dialects] where the dialect
implementaiton is done on the C level
2.  Normal REBOL based dialects using PARSE and REBOL code for
implementation


Why two different approaches?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carl, mentioned the origin for the two different concepts:

1.  PARSE provides a full range of dialects.
2.  Most dialects don't require that much power.
3.  Dialects like DRAW, EFFECT, REBCODE are small subsets
4.  A faster technique (than parse) can be used for such dialects.
5.  That technique was used for DRAW, etc. (native evaluated)
6.  I decided might as well allow it to be REBOL level too.

DELECT is also performing JIB (Just in time binding).
