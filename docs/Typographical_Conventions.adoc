Note: REBOL variables are REBOL words that are bound to a context,
unbound words don't have values.

Use:

1.  *do* to represent the value of the *_do_* variable - in a fresh
console this is a native that does not have a serialized form
2.  *none* to represent the value of the *_none_* variable - in a fresh
console this is the value that can be literally represented as
#[none] or #[none!]
3.  *true* to represent the value of the *_true_* variable - in a fresh
console this is the value that can be literally represented as
#[true]
4.  *unset!* to represent the value of the *_unset!_* variable - in a
fresh console this is the value that can be literally represented as
#[datatype! unset!]
5.  *unset* to represent the value of the *_unset_* variable - in a
fresh console this is a native that does not have a serialized form

, etc.

The above rules mean, that the #[unset!]
