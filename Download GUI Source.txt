Here are the steps to obtain the current GUI source code:

1.  Run R3
2.  Type: chat
3.  Login (if you need to)

Now type this at the chat console:

<pre> >> 2586 R3/GUI/Source: ... >> get *

`  >> 2656` +
`  R3/GUI/Source/styles-proto` +
`  ...` +
`  >> get *` `</pre>`

Now, open the source dir:

`  >> od`

Run R3 with gui-test.r to test that the GUI loads properly. A
verification window should open with text and a couple buttons.

To build the GUI as a single package file, run gui-build.r and it will
output a file: gui.r that you can use.
