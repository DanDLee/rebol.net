*This is an important note to all alpha testers:*

Test R3 one step at a time. Start with:

`  >> 1 + 2` +
`  == 3`

Then try:

`  >> a: 1` +
`  >> a + 2` +
`  == 3`

Ever see the movie, _What about Bob?_. Well: *Baby steps.* That's the
mindset.

That's what you need to do. Don't do more.

Don't <tt>do</tt> your largest script. *_We guarantee it won't work._*

Don't try obscure complex functions. They won't work! Guaranteed.

Take things just one small little step at a time. Find all those little
bugs first. We'll get those little ones fixed, then move to the next
baby step.
