Getting started with Linux is slightly different see:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

In the REBOL desktop click on the REBOL icon at the top, select DEMOS
and choose one. With left mouse click you start the demo. With right
mouse click you see the notes and if you click on the EDIT button the
source of the demo will open.

You will be amazed of how small are all REBOL applications.
