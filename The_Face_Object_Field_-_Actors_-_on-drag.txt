*on-drag* is invoked when a drag object has been created and the mouse
is moving inside the face in which the drag object was created.

on-drag usually comes after
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-click[on-click]* and ceases to
be used when the drag object is destroyed, which happens right after
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-drop[on-drop]*.

The drag object the input argument to the on-drag actor. No return value
is necessary.

When a drag object exists, the
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-move[on-move]* and
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-over[on-over]* actors are not
called.
