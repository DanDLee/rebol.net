This is a summary of R3 boot options that are currently implemented:

* *-h* - force halt at end of script - handy if you don't want the
console to close in such cases.
* *-q* - keep as quiet as possible, no splash either (still a few minor
lines).
* *-t* - trace from host mezz boot point - lots of output - (maybe we
should move this to after mezz boot?)
* *-w* - no console window - print output is ignored unless you use ECHO
function. Also, the primary interactive input loop is bypassed.

The full word versions of those should also be working.

In addition, a script file name can be provided on the command line.

Other options, not covered, probably do not work at this time.
