This describes the main details about scrolling in the link:R3 GUI[R3
GUI].


Basics
~~~~~~

If you plan on building custom styles that require scrolling, then you
will need to understand how scrolling works. Although a lot of work was
done to keep the design as simple as possible, there are still several
details that you will need to know in order to build scrollable styles.


Methods of Scrolling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In general, scrolling is done with:

* *Scrollbars* - clicking or dragging scroll bars will scroll the
content.
* *Scroll events* - input from special devices, such as scroll wheels.
* *Content* - moving or changing content that causes scrolling. For
example, moving cursor keys within text.
* *API* - functions that scroll content programmatically.

Each of these will be explained in detail below.


What can be scrolled?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Any style that provides an ON-SCROLL actor can be scrolled.* Several
such styles are provided in the standard system for scrolling panels,
text, lists, and images. To set-up scrolling for those styles is simple
and does not require any special knowledge.

It should be noted that scrolling is an action of the style and is not
dependent on the existence of a scrollbar. It is possible to have
scrollable content that has no scrollbars. In such cases, other methods
of input are available, such as a scroll wheel or arrow buttons.

For most styles the ON-SCROLL actor will change the offset of a _content
GOB_ to move it relative to a _display or clipping GOB_. However, that
is only one approach. A style can perform any action for ON-SCROLL. For
example, a 3D style may perform a zoom action for an ON-SCROLL action.

Scrollbar - state values: value and delta as percentages.

Scrollbar are state, so get/set-face. Content style uses facet as
property, therefore get/set-facet (not state).

Auto attachment. The common case.

Named attachement. For special purposes.

Face initialization sequence for auto scrolling.

Hover scrolling.

Changing content from scrollbar.

Changing scrollbars from content.

The actors:

on-scroll

on-scroll-event (wheel)

on-delta
